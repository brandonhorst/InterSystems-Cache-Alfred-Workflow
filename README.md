InterSystems-Cache-Alfred-Workflow
==================================

Basic workflow for working with an InterSystems Cach√© instance

[Download](https://github.com/brandonhorst/InterSystems-Cache-Alfred-Workflow/raw/master/CControl.alfredworkflow)

Features:

* cstart
* cstop
* crestart
* csession
* cdoc (open documentation)
* csmp (open system management portal)

Cache Instance Names are hardcoded, so you will need to change them. It could be made dynamic but this works for me. Feel free to modify and submit a PR.
